# Data-Handling-and-Prediction-Model

This project involves processing and modeling a dataset to make predictions. Initially, the dataset is loaded using Pandas, and 10% of the data is sampled for analysis. Feature engineering is performed to convert various data types into computable values and handle missing values. A machine learning model is then applied for predictions, aiming for the highest accuracy. Finally, model performance is evaluated using metrics like Precision and Recall, and progress is visualized with Plot libraries.
